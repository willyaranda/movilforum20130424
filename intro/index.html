          Every technology out there goes through the hype cycle. Everyone jumps onto it and wants to have impressive headlines which is why we inflate expectations. After a while we always realise that reality is not all rainbows and unicorns and the pendulum swings the other way. In the end we get to take the technology serious and see how it can be used productively. All of this is frustrating to techies but this is how marketing works. Just building something is not enough - you need to sell it, too.

          One of the barriers of HTML5 is hand-made. For years we've been trying to chase the dream of building one thing and make it behave the same everywhere. Instead of embracing the idea that anything on the web can make workable and then enhanced to be more comfortable for better and newer environments, we tried to shoehorn everything new into an existing outdated infrastructure.

That's neither here nor there for us as developers as all of those are fleeting and can change in months. The thing we have to worry about though is that the mobile platform as it is now is not as open to web technologies as it was heralded when people declared Flash dead.

          Fact is that we don't get access to all the hardware parts that make a smartphone interesting. In order to do that we need to package our HTML5 apps in a native wrapper and the performance of these wrappers is worse than those of the browser on these platforms. This lock-out is holding HTML5 back.

          The next issue HTML5 has to face is one of perception. The closed platforms have users conditioned that apps can be found in app stores and that it is easy to pay for them there and get upgrades from there. Regardless of what we might be thinking about these stores, people want them - right now.

          Comparing Firefox OS with Android or iOS head-on is therefore a pointless idea. The aim of Firefox OS is to replace feature phones in emerging markets. True to the main goal of Mozilla to keep the web open and affordable to everyone. It can not be that a means of mass communication and information is only for the rich in certain markets. The web is a voice for a lot of people who can not speak otherwise as their mass media is controlled. Therefore mobile web access needs to be affordable and easy for everyone.
